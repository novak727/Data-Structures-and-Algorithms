# Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository holds all programs made during my Data Structures and Algorithms class. Each folder contains a program with all necessary source code necessary to run said program. Please check each project to find which files will need to be compiled to use each program. The Individual-Programs folder contains programs that only require a single C++ source code file to compile and run the program.

The main project from this course was a text-based Interactive Fiction Game Engine, similar to a choose your own adventure style. That project can be viewed [here](https://github.com/novak727/Interactive-Fiction-Game-Engine).
# C++ Installation and Usage
The programs in this repository can be executed using the C++ language and the g++ compiler.

g++ for [Windows](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/), don't forget to add the binary to your [path environment variable](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/).

g++ can be installed on Linux using your favorite package manager.

### Run from the command line

1. Find the location of the files you want to execute.
2. Copy the path.
3. Go to the command line and run the following:
  ```sh
   cd /path/to/files
   ```

## Compile and Execute
Compile the program:
```sh
g++ program-name.cpp
```

Execute the program in Windows:
```sh
a.exe
```

Execute the program in Linux/Mac:
```sh
./a.out
```
